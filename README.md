# mario~ Mod
This is a minecraft mod that will add basic items / blocks and will extend to more advanced concepts.
Each of these makes use of advanced programming concepts such as Generics, Object Oriented Programming, Inheritance etc.

I am using the Eclipse IDE for the creation and maintenance of this mod. Through this, I will try to get more accustomed to the IDE interface, as well as improving my hierarchical structure of keeping code snippets in different classes, instead of cluttering one file with unnecessary code.
